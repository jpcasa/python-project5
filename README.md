Create a local web interface of a learning journal. The main (index) page will list journal entry titles and dates. Each journal entry title will link to a detail page that displays the title, date, time spent, what you learned, and resources to remember. Include the ability to add or edit journal entries. When adding or editing a journal entry, there must be prompts for title, date, time spent, what you learned, resources to remember.
